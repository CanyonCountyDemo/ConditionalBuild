ConditionalBuild
================

This simple project shows how you can make a single file executable in .NET while embedding additional Assemblies.

Also, if you look at the [ConditionalBuild.csproj](./ConditionalBuild/ConditionalBuild.csproj) file you will see how you can conditional Embed a Debug or Release version of an Assembly.

Hope this helps!
